"Smart Bioluminescence Integrated Hydrophonic Vertical Farming" is an innovative IoT-driven system that combines bioluminescent 
organisms with hydroponic vertical farming to create a sustainable, energy-efficient agricultural solution. By utilizing
the natural light emitted by bioluminescent microorganisms, the system reduces energy consumption, while hydroponics ensures
efficient use of water and space. Integrated IoT sensors monitor environmental conditions and automate adjustments for 
optimal plant growth, making the system ideal for urban farming and sustainable agriculture. This approach offers a compact,
eco-friendly way to grow crops in controlled environments, promoting resource conservation and high productivity.
